A tribute page to Aristotle using only HTML and CSS.

This is the second project I completed on freeCodeCamp's responsive web design course. 
I am proud of this project as I can tell a difference in the level of skill between it
and my first project on freeCodeCamp (survey-form) despite it still using just HTML and CSS.
I am a big philosophy nerd which made Aristotle the perfect person to make a tribute page for!
I really enjoyed making this project and hope you enjoy viewing it!
