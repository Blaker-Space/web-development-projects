A basic survey form using HTML & CSS

This repository contains the files for my survey form submission on freeCodeCamp.
This project only uses HTML and CSS (and could definitely use some work), 
but I am still very proud of it as it is my first ever real web development project
and stands for my desire to learn this skill... plus it is about coffee so that adds points for me!
